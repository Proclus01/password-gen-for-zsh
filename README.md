# Instructions

Copy the script from the *script.sh* file and paste it into your *.zshrc* inside your main Mac OS directory. 

Open a new terminal window

And run the script using these instructions:

***
makepw
***

It defaults to a 20-character password. 

To generate to a specific length X = 112:

***
makepw 112
***

To generate multiple instances of fresh passwords of a certain length, use the following:

***
makepw -n 5
***

This makes 5 instances of default-length passwords.

To generate multiple instances of custom-length passwords, for X = 35, use the following:

***
makepw -n 5 35
***

Which makes you 5 instances of 35-length passwords. 

# Information Entropy

To calculate the information entropy of a password generated by the `makepw` function, we need to consider the size of the character set used and the length of the password. The character set includes uppercase letters (26), lowercase letters (26), numbers (10), and special characters (32, based on the provided list). This totals to 94 possible characters for each position in the password.

The formula to calculate the entropy in bits is:

\[ \text{Entropy} = L \times \log_2(N) \]

where \(L\) is the length of the password, and \(N\) is the number of possible characters. 

Given that \(N = 94\) for this function, let's calculate the entropy for each requested password length:

1. **For a 20-character password:**

\[ \text{Entropy} = 20 \times \log_2(94) \approx 20 \times 6.5546 = 131.092 \text{ bits} \]

2. **For a 30-character password:**

\[ \text{Entropy} = 30 \times \log_2(94) \approx 30 \times 6.5546 = 196.638 \text{ bits} \]

3. **For a 128-character password:**

\[ \text{Entropy} = 128 \times \log_2(94) \approx 128 \times 6.5546 = 839.189 \text{ bits} \]

4. **For a 512-character password:**

\[ \text{Entropy} = 512 \times \log_2(94) \approx 512 \times 6.5546 = 3356.755 \text{ bits} \]

These entropy values indicate the level of security provided by the passwords, with higher values representing stronger passwords. The calculations show that as the length of the password increases, the entropy, and thus the security, increases significantly.
