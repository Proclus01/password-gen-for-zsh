# Instructions

Copy the script from the *makepw.sh* file and paste it into your *.zshrc* inside your main Mac OS directory. 

Alternatively you can set it as a bash script anywhere you wish and run it from the terminal in the same way below (with some config on the user end):

Open a new terminal window

And run the script using these instructions:

***
makepw
***

It defaults to a 20-character password. 

To generate to a specific length X = 112:

***
makepw 112
***

To generate multiple instances of fresh passwords of a certain length, use the following:

***
makepw -n 5
***

This makes 5 instances of default-length passwords.

To generate multiple instances of custom-length passwords, for X = 35, use the following:

***
makepw -n 5 35
***

Which makes you 5 instances of 35-length passwords. 

# Theoretical Information Entropy

To calculate the information entropy of a password generated by the `makepw` function, we need to consider the size of the character set used and the length of the password. The character set includes uppercase letters (26), lowercase letters (26), numbers (10), and special characters (32, based on the provided list). This totals to 94 possible characters for each position in the password.

The formula to calculate the entropy in bits is:

```
Entropy = L * log2(N)
```

where `L` is the length of the password, and `N` is the number of possible characters.

Given that `N = 94` for this function, let's calculate the entropy for each requested password length:


1. **For a 20-character password:**

```
Entropy = 20 * log2(94) ≈ 20 * 6.5546 = 131.092 bits
```

2. **For a 30-character password:**

```
Entropy = 30 * log2(94) ≈ 30 * 6.5546 = 196.638 bits
```

3. **For a 128-character password:**

```
Entropy = 128 * log2(94) ≈ 128 * 6.5546 = 839.189 bits
```

4. **For a 512-character password:**

```
Entropy = 512 * log2(94) ≈ 512 * 6.5546 = 3356.755 bits
```


These entropy values indicate the level of security provided by the passwords, with higher values representing stronger passwords. The calculations show that as the length of the password increases, the entropy, and thus the security, increases significantly.

# Actual Information Entropy

So, each of these passwords, assuming they were generated in a truly random manner from a set of 94 characters, would have an entropy of approximately 196.638 bits. 

The real information entropy values may be lower or higher:

makepw -n 15 35

As you can see, each individual password may not use the entire 94-length character set (especially if Password Length < 94).
